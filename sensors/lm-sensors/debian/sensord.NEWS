lm-sensors (1:2.9.0-7) unstable; urgency=low

  Since version 2.9.0 sensord doesn't scale the loadavg itself (* 10) as 
  RRDs work with floating-point values and thus do very well with 
  non-integer values even < 1.

  They can even be scaled later at display time by rrdtool itself using:
	DEF:load=sensord.rrd:loadavg:AVERAGE
		CDEF:load10=load,10,*
